### partygames.social

This repo contains a project that was initialy for an intro to web dev course that has since become a personal project. We initially designed everything in html/css and php, with a little bit of javascript on top. I plan on porting this to React and node.js soone rather than later.

The website has information regarding the game and how to play it but essentially its a mobile focused administration of a party game I play with friends and family. Users can create and join rooms to participate in the game and it makes the process of the game more streamlined and accessible.
